Victron

This is a custom component for connecting to the victron energy modbusTCP ....
This is an early alpha version. 
The integration will trigger errors when adding it as an integration since it scans for available registers.
Limitations are currently:
-  options are not configureable after creation
- all different "slave" units are added without seperations into devices per unit



TODO
- Switch to async
- make register list smarter
- Investigate if scan without causing errors is possible
- Improve connection loss resilience
